                        Archethic Wallet respects your privacy. We created this Privacy Policy to explain the types of
                        information we may collect through the Archethic Wallet application (the “App”), how we will
                        use, disclose and protect this information once it is collected, and how you can opt in or opt
                        out of some of uses and disclosures of certain information relating to your use of the App.
                    </p>

                    <p class="op-08">
                        Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our ethics through regarding information
                        that we collect through the App about you and your use of the App and how we will treat it. If
                        you do not agree with these policies and practices, do not download or use the App.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl mt-4">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        We may update this Privacy Policy regularly, in which case we will post the updated Privacy
                        Policy at <a href="/privacy-policy-wallet"><span
                                class="underline">https://www.archethic.net/privacy-policy-wallet</span></a>. The most
                        recent update date is
                        indicated at the end of this Privacy Policy. In some cases, we may also tell you about changes
                        by additional means, such as by informing you through an alert on the App. Your continued use of
                        the App after we make changes will be deemed to be your acceptance of those changes, so please
                        check the Privacy Policy periodically for updates.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl mt-4">What This Privacy Policy Applies To</h2>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        This Privacy Policy applies only to the App and information that we collect through the App.
                        This Privacy Policy DOES NOT, for example, apply to information that:
                    </p>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        You provide to, or is collected by, any third party.
                        Our other apps and websites, and third parties, may have their own privacy policies, which we
                        encourage you to read before using or providing safe information, through or to them. For
                        example, when you use the App on your device, certain third parties, such as your mobile device
                        manufacturer, your mobile service provider or the services you connect to may, separate from us,
                        use automatic information collection technologies to collect information about you or your
                        device, and that information they collect is not covered by this Privacy Policy. We do not
                        control these third parties’ data collection or tracking technologies or how they may be used.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl mt-4">Children Under the Age of 13</h2>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        The App is not intended for children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect
                        personal information from children under 13. If we learn we have collected or received personal
                        information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that
                        information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please
                        contact us at <a href="mailto:dpo@archethic.net"><span

                    <h2 class="text-xl mt-4">Information We Collect and How We Collect It</h2>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        We may collect information from you, as users of the App and about you only:
                    </p>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        Directly from you when you provide it to us in connection with the App
                        No personal information is required by us to use the app.
                        All private information you enter in the application (seed, keychain, pin, password, Yubikey OTP
                        configuration, accounts name, configuration and personalization options) are stored on your
                        local device only and not transmitted to anyone.

                    </p>

                    <p class="op-08">
                        Automatically when you use the App.
                        While we do not collect any personal information directly through the App, interacting with external services such as DApps may involve the sharing of some information (e.g., Archethic address, transaction details) with the third-party service for the purpose of enabling their functionality. This information exchange is required for proper operation but is not within our control.</p>

                    <p class="op-08">
                        IP Address and Archethic Address.
                        When the application connects to a server in order to fetch required ledger information, the
                        server has access to your public ip address as well as your query. This information is necessary
                        for the legitimate interest of providing the service. This does not leak more information than
                        when you query your balance on the web explorer. We do not control all of the servers you can
                        connect to. Depending on the server, logs can be kept or not, for a variable period of time. You
                        have the possibility to run a custom server you host yourself if you want to avoid any
                        information being transmitted to third party. If we process your information based on our
                        legitimate interests as explained above, you may have the right under certain laws and
                        regulations to object to such processing and may contact us to inform us of your objection via
                        email at <a href="mailto:dpo@archethic.net"><span class="underline">dpo@archethic.net</span></a>
                    </p>

                    <p class="op-08">
                        Your transaction history is immutably recorded in the Archethic Public Blockchain.
                        This transaction history is a feature of the Archethic network. No personal information is
                        collected nor stored on the network. Only Archethic addresses and their transaction data are
                        recorded, with no relationship to any personal information being added by Archethic itself. By
                        construction, there is no possible way to remove a transaction once it has been included as part
                        of the blockchain.

                    <h2 class="text-xl mt-4">Clarifications Regarding Certain Information We Do Not Collect or See</h2>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        A “Wallet Seed” is a unique code that is provided to you by the App, through its direct
                        interaction with the Archethic network (i.e., without our involvement), when you first create a
                        new wallet on the Archethic network (a “Wallet”) using the App. Your Wallet Seed is the only way
                        for you to recover your Wallet and your Keychain on the Archethic network and access any tokens
                        that you store in your Wallet. Your Wallet Seed is stored on your device and is never sent to us
                        or any third party. Therefore, you are solely responsible for the security and safeguarding your
                        Wallet Seed. We do not record, store or have access to your Wallet Seed and we cannot recover it
                        for you if you lose it.
                    </p>

                    <p class="op-08">
                        A Keychain is a new concept brought by Archethic to leverage an on-chain wallet which references
                        the seed and all the several derivation paths we can use for services (Archethic, Bitcoin,
                        Ethereum, Google, Amazon, etc.)
                    </p>

                    <p class="op-08">
                        Any tokens that you choose to hold, store, manage, receive, send or transmit using the App, and
                        any balance or transaction information relating to it, are never held, stored, known, managed,
                        received, sent or transmitted by us. You are solely responsible for the security and privacy of
                        your own Archethic currency and information relating to it.
                    </p>

                    <p class="op-08">
                        We do not track the location of your device through the App.

                    <p class="op-08">
                        We do not collect your name or contact information through the App.

                    <p class="op-08">
                    Interaction with Decentralized Applications (DApps): When you use the Archethic Wallet to access third-party decentralized applications (DApps), certain information related to your interaction with those DApps may be collected, processed, or stored by the DApps themselves or their associated infrastructure. This information is not collected, processed, or stored by us, and the privacy practices of these DApps are governed by their own privacy policies and terms of use. We encourage you to review the terms and policies of any DApp you interact with to understand how your data may be collected, used, and shared.

                    <p class="op-08">
                        We use the information that we collect about you through the App to:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="op-08">
                        <li>Provide you with, operate and maintain the App and its contents, and any other information,
                            products or services that you request from us;</li>
                        <li>Fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it;</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-xl mt-4">Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        Not with standing anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we may disclose aggregated
                        anonymous information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual or
                        device or account, to others, for their own use, without restriction.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="op-08">
                        <li>In addition, we may disclose information (including, without limitation, personal
                            information) that we collect or you provide to us:</li>

                            or regulatory request;</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-xl mt-4">Data Security</h2>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss
                        and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. Unfortunately, the transmission of
                        information via the internet and mobile platforms is not completely secure. While we endeavor to
                        protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information
                        transmitted or collected through the App. Any transmission of personal information is at your
                        own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures
                        we provide and will not have any liability for disclosure of your personal information due to
                        errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission or collection.
                    </p>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where the App has given you a
                        Wallet Seed, you are solely responsible for keeping this Wallet Seed confidential, as it can be
                        used to access your Wallet and any tokens you store in your Wallet. You should not share your
                        Wallet Seed with anyone. We do not receive, collect, record, store or have access to your Wallet
                        Seed and we cannot recover them for you if you lose them.
