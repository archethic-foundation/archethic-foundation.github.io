                        <em>The Archethic Public Blockchain is a universally autonomous intangible common good,
                            consisting of a network of decentralized and autonomous computers (Decentralized Autonomous
                            Network, DAN) and a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) composed of individuals

                    <h2 class="text-xl mt-4">Data We Collect</h2>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        Privacy is at the heart of everything we do with the Archethic Blockchain, and transparency is
                        among its values. Consequently, we strive to be transparent about the minimal data we collect.
                        We do not manage user accounts and do not collect or store personal data such as your name or
                        Internet Protocol (IP) address. When you interact with the Services, we only collect:
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl mt-4">Publicly Accessible Blockchain Data</h2>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        Before using a public blockchain, be aware that all your transactions will be publicly
                        accessible. The principle of Blockchains is to prove the existence of your holdings through the
                        history of your previous public transactions. Thus, while no public data allows for personal
                        identification (pseudonymity), anyone you exchange assets with will have public access to your
                        history. You can, however, create as many Wallets as necessary to avoid any cross-referencing.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl mt-4">Local Information and Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        Most services use cookies, beacons, and other similar technologies to provide personalized
                        navigation and optimize service performance. None of these data is retrieved or processed
                        individually. Information collected (logs, etc.) may include:

                    <p class="op-08">
                        For services that necessarily require centralization (non-limiting examples: Wallet, Stores,
                        cloud hosting, etc.) and therefore depend on the privacy policies of various providers (Apple
                        App Store, Google Play, Microsoft Store for example), data remains collected according to your
                        instructions, but as required by law, these data may be used for the following purposes:
