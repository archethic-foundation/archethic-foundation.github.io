                            consisting partly of a network of decentralized autonomous computers (Decentralized
                            Autonomous Network, DAN), and partly of a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) made
                            up of individuals (developers, users) who guide and co-validate with the DAN itself all

                    <p class="op-08">
                        There is no applicable legislation or legal entity responsible for the provision of services
                        available on the DAN. The DAN consists of computer programs subject only to the law of its
                        source code, which is freely available for consultation before use and developed by and for the
                        community.
                    </p>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        For a proper understanding and application of the legal framework, these terms of use must be
                        accepted before any use of the services provided by the DAN. It is reminded that any computer
                        system may contain security flaws or programming errors that could lead to the loss of assets
                        involved. Similarly, it is reminded that proper use of the services remains solely the
                        responsibility of the user. Thus, no legislation or legal entity can be held accountable for an
                        error during the use of the services provided by the DAN. Finally, it is reminded that any
                        cryptographic system relies on the necessity to keep one's cryptographic private key secret and
                        that the services used cannot be blamed if it is disclosed.
                    </p>

                        By accessing or using any of the services, you signify that you have read, understood, and
                        agreed to be bound by this agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree, you are not
                        authorized to use them.

                        rights, powers, and authority to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions of this

                    <h2 class="text-xl mt-4">2. Terms of Use of Archethic's DeFi Services</h2>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        In the case of decentralized financial services (DeFi), the source code and smart contracts are
                        the only participants in the various procedures. For example, in the case of "bridges" made
                        available (cryptocurrency gateways from one blockchain to another), the mechanism used relies on
                        the Atomic Swap method, in which the user remains the sole master of operations, and in which
                        there are no other stakeholders than the user himself equipped with his private key and the
                        blockchains involved.
                    </p>

                    <p class="op-08">
                        The terms of use herein explain the terms and conditions under which you can access and use the
                        decentralized finance services ("DeFi Services", "DeFi Products") provided by the autonomous and
                        decentralized network of the Archethic Public Blockchain. The Services should include, but are
                        not limited to:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li class="op-08">(a) aeBridge: a user interface for bi-directional transfer of digital assets
                            between
                            EVM-compatible or non-compatible blockchains and the Archethic Public Blockchain;</li>
                        <li class="op-08">(b) aeSwap or DEX: a user interface for decentralized exchanges hosted on the
                            Archethic
                            Public Blockchain itself and on the wallet ("Archethic Wallet" or "aeWallet");</li>
                        <li class="op-08">(c) Archethic Wallet or aeWallet: The native Archethic wallet management
                            software
                            ("Archethic Wallet", "aeWallet") for managing cryptocurrency assets (available on Mobile,
                            Windows, Linux, Mac, and Google Chrome).</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h2 class="text-xl mt-4">3. Special Cases of Liquidity Pools</h2>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        Liquidity Pools are a subset of decentralized finance (DeFi) services, particularly the DEX
                        (decentralized cryptocurrency exchange platform), where exchanges can only be made through
                        liquidity pools. Anyone is free to provide liquidity between two cryptocurrencies of their
                        choice, for example: UCO and ETH or ETH and BTC, etc.
                    </p>

                    <p class="op-08">
                        The Archethic DEX thus differentiates between two types of liquidity pools: those whose tokens
                        or counterparties have been verified by the Archethic DAO as a reliable project (notified by an
                        icon verified), and those that have not been verified and for which you take full responsibility
                        to perform all necessary checks before use.
                    </p>

                    <p class="op-08">
                        Also, even in the case of pools verified by the Archethic DAO, and as previously mentioned, any
                        computer system may contain security flaws or programming errors that could lead to the loss of
                        assets involved, hence no one can be held liable in case of loss or blocking of assets.
                    </p>


                    <h2 class="text-xl mt-4">4. Non-Exhaustive List of Services of the Archethic Public Blockchain</h2>
                    <h3 class="text-md">4.1 aeBridge/aeSwap</h3>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        The Interface provides a computer means to decentralized protocols on the Archethic public
                        blockchain that allows users to transfer digital assets between blockchains (the "aeBridge
                        protocol") or to exchange certain compatible digital assets (the "aeSwap protocol").
                    </p>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        The interface is distinct from the protocol and is one of the means, but not exclusive, to
                        access the protocol. Each protocol includes open source or available source self-executing smart
                        contracts that are deployed on the Archethic public blockchain.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-uppercase fw-bold op-08">
                        THE DEFI PROTOCOL IS PROVIDED "AS IS", AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.
                    </p>

                    <p class="op-08">
                        No developer or entity involved in the creation of the DeFi protocol will be liable for any
                        claim or damage associated with your use, inability to use, or your interaction with other users
                        of the DeFi protocol, including any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive,
                        or consequential damages, or loss of profits, cryptocurrencies, tokens, or any other value.
                    </p>

                    <p class="op-08">
                        The aeBridge protocol has been deployed on EVM-compatible and Archethic blockchains, while the
                        aeSwap protocol is exclusive to the Archethic Public Blockchain. Please note that digital assets
                        from EVM blockchains that have been "bridged" or "wrapped" to function on the blockchain are
                        distinct from the original main network EVM asset.
                    </p>

                    <p class="op-08">
                        In the case of aeBridge, to access the Interface, you must use non-custodial wallet software,
                        which allows you to interact with public blockchains (an EVM-compatible wallet and an
                        Archethic-compatible wallet). Your relationship with these non-custodial wallet providers is
                        governed by the applicable service terms.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-md">4.2 The Archethic Wallet</h3>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        The Archethic Wallet allows storing digital assets; displaying addresses and information that
                        are part of the digital asset networks and broadcast transactions; signing Bridge or DEX
                        transactions; and executing any additional service available on the Archethic Public Blockchain.
                        Aside from the user himself, no entity backs up or controls the content of your wallet so no one
                        can be able to recover or transfer its content. You can consult the information and conditions
                        available at: <a href="/hot-wallet"><span class="underline">https://www.archethic.net/hot-wallet/</span></a>.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-md">4.3 Third-Party Services and Content</h3>
                    <p class="op-08">
                    When you use any of the services made available from the Archethic Public Blockchain, you may also use the products, services, or content of one or more third parties. Your use of these third-party products, services, or content may be subject to separate policies, terms of use, and fees from these third parties, and you agree to comply with and be responsible for these policies, terms of use, and fees, as applicable. The operation of each third-party service or DApp is governed by its own specific terms of use, and by interacting with any such service or DApp, you acknowledge and agree to abide by those terms. The Archethic network and its contributors assume no responsibility for the compliance, validity, or enforcement of these third-party terms.
                    </p>

                    <p class="op-08">
                    We implement and maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security measures to help protect data against loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, transmission via the Internet is not entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information. You are responsible for all your activities on the Services, including the security of your blockchain network addresses, your cryptocurrency wallets, and their cryptographic keys.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-md">4.4 Bridging ERC-20 UCO Tokens Between EVM Blockchains via the Wormhole Protocol
                    </h3>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        A third-party widget providing access to the Wormhole protocol is available through a
                        third-party access point within the Archethic bridge, enabling the transfer of UCO tokens
                        between EVM-compatible blockchains. Its operation is governed by the specific terms of use of
                        Wormhole. Before using this service, the user must review and accept Wormhole's terms and
                        conditions of use.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-md">4.5 ERC-20 UCO Token Migration</h3>
                    <p class="op-08">
                        A service allows the migration of ERC-20 UCO tokens to version 2 via a smart contract deployed
                        on EVM-compatible blockchains. This migration is essential to ensure that users' tokens remain
                        up-to-date with the latest security and compatibility standards across all ERC-20 compatible
                        blockchains.
